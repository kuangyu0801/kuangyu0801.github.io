# Work Experience
**IBM**, Böblingen, Germany

*Intern*, IBM Systems, Apr. 2021 - Sept. 2021 (6 months)
- Developed a cloud-native C++ remote IDE (integrated development environment) for Ubuntu on z15 mainframe based on [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org/) and [VSCode Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) using Scrum approach
 
- Verified IDE feasibility and compatibility by deploying and testing Eclipse Theia on [Hyper Protect Virtual Server](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/hyper-protect-virtual-servers) and [Eclipse Che](https://www.eclipse.org/che/) on Minikube
- Integrated, tested, and deployed C++ dev tools to [Codeready Workspace](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/codeready-workspaces)  w/ CMake, IntelliSense, CTest, GDB and GoogleTest functionality on a self-administered [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform) on zFyre
- Improved [z/CECSIM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5389024) server development productivity by rewriting traces (15 files and 400 lines) from C filestream API to POSIX system call, to ensure trace visibility when crashing.

**MediaTek, Inc**, Hsinchu, Taiwan

*Firmware Engineer*, Modem Signal Processing, Communication System Design, Dec. 2015 - Aug. 2019 (3 years 9 months)
- Developed embedded firmware in MediaTek’s Android platform for 4G LTE and 5G NR physical layer (PHY) digital signal processing
- Contributed to 6k and maintained 20k lines of code in C/C++ for 3 large-scale projects (over 200k lines and 1,000 developers) including 2019 world’s fastest 5G modem [Helio M70](https://www.mediatek.com/blog/heres-5gs-real-speed-live-connection-demo) with downlink throughput of 4.7 Gbps
- Designed mobile modem receiver modules, implemented OFDM signal processing algorithms accordant with [3GPP Spec](https://www.3gpp.org/specifications), integrated build and auto testing process for design and system verification with Perl and Python scripts
- Resolved urgent system function and performance issues for over 10 MediaTek’s [Helio X and P series smartphone products](https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones) with log examination, signal and procedure analysis, solution formulation and implementation, patch verification and release
- Received 7 MediaTek vAwards (top 10\% monthly team performance) including  improving 4G downlink data rate by 300\% (14$\rightarrow$42 Mbps) with Massive MIMO feature and reducing 5G control channel decoding computation  cycles by 72\% (3700$\rightarrow$1000 cycles)
