# Work Experience
**IBM**, Böblingen, Germany
*Intern*, IBM Systems, Apr. 2021 - Sept. 2021 (6M)
- Developing a cloud-native C++ remote development environment for Ubuntu  on  z15 mainframe for \href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5389024}{z/CECSIM} team using scrum approach
- Verified IDE feasibility and compatibility by deploying and testing  \href{https://theia-ide.org/}{Eclipse Theia} on Hyper Protect Server and \href{https://www.eclipse.org/che/} {Eclipse Che} on Minikube
- Integrated, tested, and deployed C++ dev tools to  \href{https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/codeready-workspaces}{Codeready Workspace}  w/ CMake, IntelliSense, CTest, GDB and GoogleTest functionality on a self-administered \href{https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform}{OpenShift Container Platform} on zFyre
- Improved z/CECSIM server development productivity by rewriting traces (15 files and 400 lines) from C filestream API to POSIX system call, to ensure trace visibility when crashing.

**MediaTek, Inc**, Hsinchu, Taiwan
*Firmware Engineer*, Modem Signal Processing, Communication System Design, Dec. 2015 - Aug. 2019 (3Y9M)
- Developed embedded firmware in MediaTek’s Android platform for 4G LTE and 5G NR physical layer (PHY) digital signal processing
- Contributed to 6k and maintained 20k lines of code in C/C++ for 3 large-scale projects (over 200k lines and 1,000 developers) including 2019 world’s fastest 5G modem  \href{https://www.mediatek.com/blog/heres-5gs-real-speed-live-connection-demo
}{Helio M70} with downlink throughput of 4.7 Gbps
- Designed mobile modem receiver modules, implemented OFDM signal processing algorithms accordant with  \href{https://www.3gpp.org/specifications}{3GPP Spec}, integrated build and auto testing process for design and system verification with Perl and Python scripts
- Resolved urgent system function and performance issues for over 10 MediaTek’s \href{https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones}{Helio X and P series smartphone products} with log examination, signal and procedure analysis, solution formulation and implementation, patch verification and release
- Received 7 MediaTek vAwards (top 10\% monthly team performance) including  improving 4G downlink data rate by 300\% (14$\rightarrow$42 Mbps) with Massive MIMO feature and reducing 5G control channel decoding computation  cycles by 72\% (3700$\rightarrow$1000 cycles)
