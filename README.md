## Introduction: Talk about something about yourself
- Background: I came from Taiwan
- Current Status: I and IT student in my third semester, expected to graduate on 2021 Oct.
- Work experience: mediatek (the 4th largest IC design company and 2nd largest smart phone chip) as firmware engineer for 4G and 5G smartphone for almost 4 years
- https://www.telecomlead.com/telecom-chips/top-ten-ic-design-companies-for-q2-2020-96567
- Future Goal: software engineer, full-stack, cloud architect
- Focus on cloud computing, distributed system and network

# [Top 10 Question](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/Top-10-Interview-Questions-Prep)
**1. What are your weaknesses?**
- i am too eager to deliver result or accomplishment, so big projects always frustrates me a little in the beginning
	- later i learn from the idea of agile development, instead of doing all the survey in the front, i break each goals and requirement into small task and start early and move fast.
- i am not really great at saying no to others, in the end, it will only make me work more, so later when i was assigned an role, i will clear out the responsibility and clarify the task so that other won't have false 

**2. Why should we hire you?**
- Focus on the employer’s needs 
	+ requirement: state-of-the-art software development, very proficient in Java programming, Python or Bash, Git 
- Reflect on the job itself: in mediatek, i have worked on large project, version control, build , testing. regression, CR handling, issue report
- Address cultural fit: I have the working experience also in a big company and know the general workflow and possess good communication skill
- can cooperate communicate with people from different background, fluent in English
- plus i learn thing rather fast, i think i can contribute the job

 **3. Why do you want to work here?**
IBM has always been my top choice. IBM was and is still a technology giant with a diverse and globalized team and probably the only company that is still doing research and development while being a commercial success. 
From circuit design to AI, i believe working in IBM will be a very crucial stepping stone for my future career.
Also I could use the internship opportunity to get hands on experience on industry level project
Chip, DeepBlue, 
My supervisor in was an J. Watson Research Center, Manager, High-Perf. Circuit Design

**4. What are your goals?**
My goal is to become a software developer for my career. 
I believe the trend of digitalization will go even further in the future and more and more commercial opportunity.
ABC (AI, Big Dat, Cloud)
 
 Also i think a software career is longstanding and self-developing, and flexibel,
 i could either work in a big company or start one-man studio, doing free-lancing jobs
 there are a lot new technology, material, tutorial online courses.

**5. Why did you leave (or why are you leaving) your job?**
- **STAR: shift-career**
- I want to shift my career into cloud computing and software development 
- firmware development for me is a turning point, so I made the decision for career shift.
- The prospect of cloud computing and software development is enormous, right now every services is on the cloud! (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS)
- The gross of telecommunication is limited, if you look at the technology behind 5G which is an optimized version of 4G, with same technology MIMO and OFDM, unlike from 3G to 4G is a huge leap
- people 
- Also the the IC/hardware industry has reached a saturation of demand, right now it about service not product. 
- The computing power of hardware is more than enough
- ex. people buy new smartphone every two and three years but pay  spotify and netflix every month

**6. When were you most satisfied in your job?**
- STAR: 1st 5G 
The time we have our first 5G test chip back and my code is running smoothly. The first 5G attachment and phonecall is made.
see my code is actually running with the chip and the correct configuration with new 5G test machine: UXM 5G 無線測試平台 from keysight 
Radio Communication Test Station MT8000A from Anritsu

Seeing my code actually work in real-world environment, not just some self-simulation environment is really satisfying! All the theory, algorithm, HW/SW implementation works hand-in hand
 **7. What can you do for us that other candidates can't?**
- highly-motivated in area of software and cloud
- fast learner
- team player from previous work experience, technically wise i have participated in 3 large project across team
- rigorous programming with  6K code lines, reviewed and maintained 20K code lines in C/C++
**8. What are three positive things your last boss would say about you?**
- responsible ( delivery result),  case in point: 4G LTE MIMO. 5G phonecall
- self-motivating
- teamplayer, case in point: 4G/5G issue handling and 5G MTK, Keysight joint boot-camp

 **9. What salary are you seeking?**
- 1,500 pro Monat als intern 
- 100,000 pro Jahre als FullTime

**10. If you were an animal, which one would you want to be?**
 
 **11. Why do you want to study another master in Germany**
- I want to shift my career into software. I had a HW background, but my first job in a smart phone company is FW developer. Then I started to realized that, nowadays everything is all about software. People are paying Spotify/Netflix every month but only buy a smartphone every two to three year. Oppurtunity is  more about delivering "Service" than producing "Product".
- german has the strongest ecomony and offer good job oppurtunities: Amzaon, Microsoft, Google all have bases in DE. All so, automobile industry in DE are very strong, in the near future, car compay
- i believe in formal education, although there are online courses but fundamental is important, the quality of education in german uni is very high
## ** Would you continue to work if given return offer**
- Ja

### 4G Massive MIMO Feature (STAR name: 4G MIMO)
- Customer obsession, 
- **Situation**: Customer(Samsung) wants new feature  4G LTE Massive MIMO to be supported in the existing product
- of course we could argue with customer 
- **Task**: implementing patch for new feature (4G LTE Massive MIMO) with limited HW capability
	- the project was so old that simulation platform is no longer maintained, also no pattern
	- only log analysis
	- target and lab equipment
- **Action**:
	- clarify user scenario with customer and field trial tester
	- evaluate HW/FW capability from the given scenario
	- discuss possible solution from algorithm team
	- implement patch with limited environment (without simulation environment direct to smartphone in emulation mode, (work until 2pm)
	- reconstruct test environment in internal lab and test and verify the result
	- release patch and analyze the log for bug and improvement for several round
- **Result**: downlink data rate by 300% (42Mbps) in LTE Massive MIMO feature
	-  release on time and new feature is added
	- customer is satisfied

### 5G Module Cycle optimization (STAR name: 5G optimization)
- **Situation**: After first 5G phone call, the existing code is flexible yet low HW u-rate and high cycle
	- 5G Control Channel code is not optimized, low utilization of hardware DSP
	- We even have several review meeting, my supervisor let me handle this independently
	- The reason is that, in the beginning, we are only aiming at functionality
- **Task**: improving  HW u-rate and reduce cycle
- **Action**: 
	- evaluate the potential  optimization in the current HW/FW architecture
	- discuss coordinate with CSD algorithm team, HW designer, Modem Architect
	- review the code module by module , scenario by scenario
	- implement and verify with UT and IT
	- validate the result with phone call test, and measure cycles for improvement
	- independently handle the review process
- **Result**:  Reduced computation cycle by 72% (less than 1K cycles) in 5G control channel decoding
	- u-rate is high

### MediaTek's first 5G Modem Helio M70 (World’s fastest) development (STAR name: 1st 5G) 
- **Situation**: 2018, MediaTek has always been a quick follower but never a leader. In 5G era, company decide to move forward and compete with industry leader Qualcomm
	- External challenge: develop, vendor, operator not aligned
- **Task**:  Develop 5G FW for Control Channel when spec and architecture is on-going, balance between ***flexibility for on-going spec***, ***performance for customer***,  ***deadline*** and ***cost for company benefit***
- **Action**: 
	- cost for company benefit
		+ analyze and summarize the strength and shortcoming of previous generation DSP architecture from user experience and simulation statistic
		+ study the current DSP architecture (high efficient instruction, memory addressing) and give it feedback to HW/Compiler/System Service design team when found possible optimization or bug
		+ consistently polling performance and feedback to algorithm team and HW
	- flexibility for on-going spec
		+ work hand-in-hand with  CSD algorithm team  :weekly update meeting, test case design,
		+ keep myself the latest spec release up-to-date and actively resolve ambiguity with Spec Review team when happened
	- Performance for customer
		+ CR handling solve issue with daily review meeting twice on phone call bubble chart
		+ collaborating closely with intra-team (SW higher layer, test engineering,  HW), external team(vendor, and operator) to resolve issue
	- Tight Deadline
		- 	design and review UT and IT test case on necessity basis
		- start lean and verification at earliest possible (with overlapping developing plan) 
		- implementing functionality on simulation environment, FPGA, test chip, product with machine
		- help RF team with log examining
- **Result**: 
	- 2019, 5G functionality successfully verified with UXM 5G and Radio Communication Test Station MT8000A from Anritsu
	- 2020, now the product is adopted with customer OPPO, VIVO, Xiaomi
### Shift My Career to Software Development
- **Situation**:  After working three years in the world's largetst integarated circuit design company as firmware engineer for three year, I realized that every is about software and want to shift my career.
	- **Task**: Series of decision  
		- Which path to take? gradually shift in work or almost restart
	- **Action**: 
		- gather information online and from friend
		- prepare and apply for school while working
		- learning from scratch online
		- learning german
	- **Result**:
		- internship offer from IBM
		- Amazon OA1~OA3 complete 
- I want to shift my career into cloud computing and software development 
- firmware development for me is a turning point, so I made the decision for career shift.
- The prospect of cloud computing and software development is enormous, right now every services is on the cloud! (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS)
- The gross of telecommunication is limited, if you look at the technology behind 5G which is an optimized version of 4G, with same technology MIMO and OFDM, unlike from 3G to 4G is a huge leap
- people 
- Also the the IC/hardware industry has reached a saturation of demand, right now it about service not product. 
- The computing power of hardware is more than enough
- ex. people buy new smartphone every two and three years but pay  spotify and netflix every month

### Keysight-MediaTek 5G NR Data Demo Camp in Beijing (STAR code: 5G On-site)
- **
- **Situation**: 1st 5G Data Phone Call on a rush schedule before new year.
	- Keysight-MediaTek starts their first 5G NR Data Demo Camp in Beijing. Deadline are approaching for we only have 10 days to finish before the new year, and delay would result in next developping stage.
-  **Task**: 
	- HQ Cannot provide a testable executable for testing. By that time DSP and MCU bin files are conflicting with each other with all sorts of error and. 
	- The project team makes us the 3rd in priority. 
	- Branches are messy
	- Asking some in HQ to shelve a patch for here is almost impossible
-  **Action**:  I took the liberty of merging the code on my own
	- examine and compare the daily regression report
	- creating local branches, submitting individual IT testing. After comfirming a solid bin, I use this for testing.
-  **Result**:  The load worked and we can proceed with further developing and verification without being hold back-by-HQ

### Projects from Android

# 軟體工程師自學

## 給外行人的工程師自學手冊
[這份完整的學習手冊，讓你自學成為獨當一面的軟體工程師](https://t.goodbits.io/f/a/dTiKn4HMYKXTcr48Qz10Cg~~/AAB5kwA~/RgRgXeHlP0QWaHR0cHM6Ly91YmluLmlvL2V6dHdLNVcDc3BjQgoAIetce17gBJIBUhNsaTUwOTE2a3VAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAAA)
這份文件是由現任職 Amazon 的 John Washam 整理而成。當初他會想要製作這份文件，是因為發現自學網頁開發的他，其實並不具備成為 Google 的工程師的電腦知識。在經過連續幾個月，每天 8-12 個小時的自學之後，雖然最後沒應徵上 Google，但也成功加入 Amazon 擔任軟體工程師。  
  
這份文件就是他將過去的學習經驗所彙整出的學習手冊，詳列出成為軟體工程師，所需學習的電腦知識（如演算法、資料結構等）與可運用的學習資源（網站或書本）。更傳授學習電腦知識與練習解題的心法，以及準備履歷與面試的技巧。即便已是工程師的讀者，編輯認為你也能從中獲得不少收穫。雖然本文也有[簡體中文的版本](https://t.goodbits.io/f/a/Q9Q2cC16QjGr2OtmM5vXEg~~/AAB5kwA~/RgRgXeHlP0QWaHR0cHM6Ly91YmluLmlvL2c1YXdTZFcDc3BjQgoAIetce17gBJIBUhNsaTUwOTE2a3VAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAAA)，但編輯發現到有些許錯字，建議大家可以中英對照著一起閱讀。

### JetBrains IDE Version Control with Git
- [All we need to know about git from Jetbrain](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-git-integration.html)
- [Version control](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/version-control-integration.html)
- [Check out a project from a remote host (clone)](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/set-up-a-git-repository.html#clone-repo)
- [Push your Project to Github directly](https://youtu.be/Zx74laLnFvw)
1. VCS | Enable Version Control Integration
2. VCS | Import into Version Control | Create Git Repository
3. Add files to the local repository: 做這一步之後所有檔案的顏色會從紅色變成綠色、從unresolved files改成default changelist
4. VCS | Import into Version Control | Share Project on Github
- [Exclude files from version control (ignore)](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/set-up-a-git-repository.html#ignore-files)
1.  [如何在IDE中與github repo協作](https://youtu.be/lyiBnyPPnG4)
		- FETCH: 把remote commit file抓到local但不改變local <- 不想要被蓋掉選這個！
		- PULL: FETCH + auto MERGE + auto COMMIT to local <- 無腦拿remote蓋掉全部，如果local有改動就很危險
		- UPDATE PROJECTS: FETCH from all remote branches + MERGE + COMMIT to local
2. 建立Branch
	- 建立local branch go to menu bar click "VCS" -> "Git" -> "Branches" -> "create branch"  
	- 建立remote branch: push 之後就會自動建立 remote branch  
3. 如何merge changes?  "VCS" -> "Git" -> "Merge Changes" 詳情參考  
	- [JetBrain文章](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/apply-changes-from-one-branch-to-another.html)  
	- [Youtube教學How and when do I merge or rebase?](https://youtu.be/Nftif2ynvdA)

4.  如何rebase?  "VCS" -> "Git" -> "rebase"
[Keeping Feature Branches Up To Date With Rebasing | Git Workflows](https://youtu.be/dqVqMwLzOjU)

6. Rebase vs. Merge
dev 是基於 master-v1拉出來，並且新增兩個feacture in v2, v3. 同時master又進了一個改動v2.

master |dev| description 
---|---|---
 v10 | - | master branch 
 v10 | v1 (same as master v10) |  branch out dev (dev的基板是master-v10)
 v10 | v2 (+ feat_a) |  dev add a feature
 v10 | v3 (+ feat_b)|  dev add another feature
 v11 (+ bugfix) | v3 (+ feat_a + feat_b)|  master fix bug (這時master已經進到v11, need to rebase)
 v11 (+ bugfix) | v4 (+ feat_a + feat_b + bugfix)| dev "rebase onto master-v11"(這時dev已經涵蓋master所有改動）
 v12 (+ feat_a + feat_b + bugfix) | v5 (same as master v12)| merge dev into master, master包含所有feature


 6. reset HEAD (進階超好用功能, 基本上等於還原)
	 - situation: 想要還原到某個commit的版本 (ex. v3, 現在是v6), 我在local commit一個超過100mb的檔案, 造成push fail/rejection, 此刻我不能使用revert, 因為revert是把檔案刪掉之後再建一個CL, 之前的commit還是在push queue裡面, 這個時候就要使用reset
		 - soft: rollback local files to v3 with changes from v4, v5, v6 to a single CL
		 - hard:

## How to create your own git feature branch?  
- 建立local branch go to menu bar click "VCS" -> "Git" -> "Branches" -> "create branch"  
- 建立remote branch: push 之後就會自動建立 remote branch  
- 如何merge changes?  "VCS" -> "Git" -> "Merge Changes" 詳情參考

## Commit Message要怎麼寫才好
```
Header: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
 - type: 代表 commit 的類別：feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore，必要欄位。
 - scope 代表 commit 影響的範圍，例如資料庫、控制層、模板層等等，視專案不同而不同，為可選欄位。
 - subject 代表此 commit 的簡短描述，不要超過 50 個字元，結尾不要加句號，為必要欄位。

Body: 72-character wrapped. This should answer:
 * Body 部份是對本次 Commit 的詳細描述，可以分成多行，每一行不要超過 72 個字元。
 * 說明程式碼變動的項目與原因，還有與先前行為的對比。

Footer: 
 - 填寫任務編號（如果有的話）.
 - BREAKING CHANGE（可忽略），記錄不兼容的變動，
   以 BREAKING CHANGE: 開頭，後面是對變動的描述、以及變動原因和遷移方法。
```
